A simple Fabric mod that adds pill-shaped consumables to remove negative status effects.

### Warped Wart
A new ingredient that can be crafted by combining 1 Nether Wart and 4 Warped Roots. Used to create Antidotes.

### Plastic Lump
A new ingredient that can be crafted by combining 6 Phantom Membranes, 1 Iron Nugget, and 2 of many different types of plants. Used to create Antidotes.

### Antidotes

To create Antidotes, you need to combine 2 Plastic Lumps and 1 Warped Wart in the Crafting Grid placed in a horizontal line. This will give you 1 Dull Antidote.

You can consume Dull Antidotes, but as the name suggests, they wonâ€™t do anything. You need to combine them with other items.

Combine 8 Dull Antidotes and 1 of a specific item that corresponds with the type of Antidote you are trying to create. You will then get 8 of the specific Antidote.
